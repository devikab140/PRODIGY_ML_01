## Implementing a Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction
To Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

## About Dataset
The dataset used here is from https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/california-housing-prices-data-extra-features.This dataset includes 80 attributes related to housing, with 1460 entries in the training set and 1459 in the test set. The training set also includes the target variable "SalePrice". Attributes are a mix of numerical and categorical data, with some missing values in columns like "LotFrontage", "Alley", and basement features. Preprocessing is needed to handle these missing values before building predictive models for house prices.

## Project Objective
Utilize the housing dataset to implement a linear regression model predicting house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. This task enhances data presentation skills and understanding of real estate market trends.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals key insights into how square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms affect house prices. The linear regression model provides a solid foundation for future real estate data science investigations and decision-making processes.
