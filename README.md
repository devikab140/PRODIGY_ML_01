## About Dataset
The dataset used here is from https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/california-housing-prices-data-extra-features.This dataset includes 80 attributes related to housing, with 1460 entries in the training set and 1459 in the test set. The training set also includes the target variable "SalePrice". Attributes are a mix of numerical and categorical data, with some missing values in columns like "LotFrontage", "Alley", and basement features. Preprocessing is needed to handle these missing values before building predictive models for house prices.
